        I have hands-on experience working on medium-scale web projects during
        my internship at ZetaSoft Pvt. Ltd., where I contributed to both
        front-end and back-end development. My experience spans the MERN stack,
        Laravel, and RESTful APIs, giving me a solid foundation in building
        dynamic, responsive, and scalable web applications.
